**Background**
======
Hello! I am a PhD candidate in the Genetics Department at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (AECOM). My research focuses primarily on breast cancer initiation, utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing.

I earned my Master’s in Biomedical Sciences from AECOM and my Bachelor’s in Biology from the University of Pennsylvania. Additionally, I spent two years as a postbaccalaureate fellow at the National Institutes of Health.

**Skills and Interests**
======
As a computational biologist, I apply computational tools and omics technologies to address challenges in cancer research. I am highly proficient in R and transcriptomic data analysis and possess strong skills in clinical data analysis.

Currently, I serve as one of the co-chairs for the Einstein-Montefiore Omics Club, which is dedicated to educating the community on the applications of omics technologies. In the past, we’ve hosted multiple seminars, workshops, and networking events.

In my personal time, I have a passion for food. I enjoy cooking at home and exploring cuisines from various cultures around New York City.
